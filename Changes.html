<h2>Version 0.9.5:</h2>

<dl>

<dt>[BPR]<dd> Modified LJGroup and LJFriend's compare: and isEqual: methods to make sure
      they were consistent.  This may fix a bug where groups were being deleted
      from the server but not removed when sync'ed.

</dl>

<h2>Version 0.9.4: 2003-03-21</h2>

<dl>

<dt>[FS]<dd>  Fixed bug in [LJFriend updateFriendSet:withReply:account:] where a pointer
      to a released object was not being set to nil.
<dt>[BPR]<dd> LJMoods reimplemented.  Now uses two parallel arrays instead of a trie.
      Much cleaner and still efficient (O(log n)).
<dt>[BPR]<dd> LJFriend* notifications have been removed due to difficulties with
      NSNotificationQueue.  They will return after 1.0.
<dt>[BPR]<dd> Calls to [NSCoder allowsKeyedCoding] have been removed, since when they
      returned false LJKit would raise an exception, which is what the Obj-C
      runtime will do anyway if you try to use an archiver that doesn't support
      keyed coding.
<dt>[BPR]<dd> Removed all implicit calls to downloadFriends and downloadGroups.  Now 
      methods like [LJAccount friendArray] return nil if the information is
      not available, and an empty array if the account has no friends.  This is
      because I believe a simple accessor should not initiate a network 
      connection.
<dt>[BPR]<dd> Removed [LJAccount downloadGroups] and [LJAccount uploadGroups].  Their
      functionality has been rolled into downloadFriends/uploadFriends.  Why?
      The most important reason is that this will force friend and group info
      to stay synchronized.  Clients that allow friends editing should also
      keep group info synchronized.  Clients that are not interested in friends
      will still have access to group info --- that is downloaded once during 
      login.  To keep group info up-to-date without download the friends list,
      clients can just re-login.
<dt>[BPR]<dd> Updated [LJAccount userPicturesMenu] to leave out the separator if there 
      are no picture keywords defined.
<dt>[BPR]<dd> Updated [LJAccount initialize] to take only the last space-separated item
      of CFBundleShortVersionString as the client version number, so
      "MyClient version 6.8b" becomes "6.8b".
<dt>[BPR]<dd> Updated [LJAccount _journalArrayFromLoginReply:] so that existing 
      LJJournal objects are recycled, not recreated, on each login.
<dt>[BPR]<dd> HttpURLs.m has NOT been modified for the new LiveJournal URL format.  New
      code has been written but left commented out, because although LiveJournal
      and uJournal are using the new URLs, DeadJournal and AboutMyLife.net are
      not.

</dl>

<dt>[BPR]<dd> Fixed [LJAccount checkGroupSet]: missing parens, always returned empty set
<dt>[BPR]<dd> Moved friends checking code into a new class: LJCheckFriendsSession
<dt>[BPR]<dd> Added LJAccount groupMaskFromSet/Array:, groupArray/SetFromMask:

<dt>[BPR]<dd> Uses CFBundleShortVersionString instead of CFBundleVersion to compose the
      login clientversion and the User-Agent key.  This is to please folks who
      are using apple-generic versioning.

<p> Notes:
<ul>
<li> Thanks to Fraser Speirs for his input and advice for the new features in 
  this version.
<li> There are bugs in LJMoods.  If you can find them, I'll be very grateful.
<li> This release is mostly untested, so there may be bugs elsewhere, too.
</ul>

<h2>Version 0.9.2: 2003-01-24</h2>

<dl>

<dt>[BPR]<dd> Removed Documentation folder and HeaderDoc build phase from project.
      You can build these things manually if you like; it makes no sense to
      regenerate them on every recompile.
<dt>[BPR]<dd> Added [LJAccount initWithContentsOfFile:] and [LJAccount writeToFile:]
<dt>[BPR]<dd> Added [LJEntry initWithContentsOfFile:] and [LJEntry writeToFile:]
<dt>[BPR]<dd> Now [LJServer httpURL] omits port number if equal to 80.
<dt>[BPR]<dd> Added [LJGroup membersEntriesHttpURL]
<dt>[BPR]<dd> Added _account field to LJFriend and updated initializer methods
<dt>[BPR]<dd> Added [LJFriend userProfileHttpURL] and [LJFriend recentEntriesHttpURL]
<dt>[BPR]<dd> Added [LJAccount friendNamed:]
<dt>[BPR]<dd> Changed LJServer to use CFNetwork instead of BSD sockets.
<dt>[BPR]<dd> Changed LJServer to use NSURLs instead of hostnames and ports.
<dt>[BPR]<dd> Renamed method setCheckAllFriends to setCheckingForAllFriends
<dt>[BPR]<dd> Changed CheckFriends category to use a thread instead of a timer.
      This removes the UI interruption that would occur during a check.  The
      related notifications are still sent on the main thread.
<dt>[BPR]<dd> Fixed a bug in URLEncoding that caused extended characters to get mangled.
<dt>[BPR]<dd> Changed SafeSetObject() to use isEqual:
<dt>[BPR]<dd> Changed Friends and Groups to use modification dates instead of isEdited.
      The dates can be used to determine if a group is newer than a journal
      entry, and thus doesn't apply to it.
      LJFriend and LJGroup instances are modified, never replaced during 
      downloadFriends and downloadGroups.
<dt>[BPR]<dd> Rewrote ParseLJReplyData; replaced NSScanner with a call to 
      [NSString componentsSeparatedByString]; fixes a bug which caused
      a parsing failure when a key had an empty value.
<dt>[BPR]<dd> Updated LJFriend to correctly handle birthdates with no years.
<dt>[BPR]<dd> Fixed [LJEntry webItemID] (itemID and aNum were reversed)
<dt>[BPR]<dd> LJAccount and LJFriend now force usernames to lowercase.
<dt>[BPR]<dd> Created SafeSetString() to normalize empty strings to nil.
<dt>[BPR]<dd> Moved code into LJEntryRoot, shared between LJEntry and LJEntrySummary.
<dt>[BPR]<dd> Added LJEntry posterUsername.
<dt>[BPR]<dd> Changed LJEntry to use NSDate instead of NSCalendarDate.
<dt>[BPR]<dd> Added isLoggedIn method to LJAccount.
<dt>[BPR]<dd> Added support for "defaultpicurl"; available in the userpics dictionary
      using the empty string as the key.
<dt>[BPR]<dd> Added ImmutablizeObject()
<dt>[BPR]<dd> Added LJAccount friendEnumerator, groupEnumerator, and friendOfEnumerator.
<dt>[BPR]<dd> Added LJGroup nonMemberArray and nonMemberSet.
<dt>[BPR]<dd> Added LJAccount (joined,watched)Community(Array,Set) methods.
