This is my To Do List for the LJKit.  Not everything here is guaranteed to be 
done.  You have the source, so feel free to tackle any of these yourself.

TO BE DONE FOR 1.0

TO BE DONE FOR 1.1

TODO: Update HTTP URL methods

TODO: Remove calls to [NSString cString]; to be deprecated in the future.
    Only used in MD5HexDigest() function.

TODO: Have methods that accept enumerators.
  Move others into convenience categories?

TODO: Add notifications
  - LJGroupCreatedNotification
  - LJGroupDeletedNotification
  - LJGroupChangedNotification
    object: the LJGroup instance
  - LJFriend(Of)AddedNotification
  - LJFriend(Of)RemovedNotification
  - LJFriendChangedNotification
    object: the LJFriend instance
  - LJAccount(Will/Did/DidNot)(Upload/Download)(Friends/Groups)
    object: the LJAccount instance

TODO: Code Style: Review all HeaderDoc comments
    Some of it was hastily written.
    Project Builder doesn't like the way I've indented the comments, but I don't
    know what it wants.

TODO: LJServer Proxy Code
  - CFHTTPReadStreamSetProxy() is deprecated.  It should be replaced with a call
    to CFReadStreamSetProperty(stream, kCFStreamPropertyHTTPProxy, info) where
    info is a CFDictionary.  The info object can be acquired from the
    SystemConfiguration.framework and passed to this function without
    modification.
  - Add a setProxyInfo: method which will save the proxy info dictionary.
  - Modify setProxyURL: to internally create a proxyInfo CFDictionary.
  - Create a detectProxyInfo method which will automatically pull the proxy
    settings from SystemConfiguration.framework.

TODO: Code Style: Private Methods
  - Prefix all private methods with an underscore (_)
  - Move all private methods declarations into a PrivateMethods category.

TODO: Implement syncitems
    It's the only thing we don't do.
    
TODO: Use accessor methods wherever possible, to make subclassing and debugging more 
    logical.

TODO: Add property list methods to codable objects.
    - (id)propertyList;
    - (id)initWithPropertyList:;
    Could we make an archiver to do this?  Didn't somebody already do that?

TO BE DONE FOR 1.2

TODO: Implement LJPoll, LJPollQuestion objects
