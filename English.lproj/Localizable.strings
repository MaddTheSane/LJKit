/*
    Previously, when LJKit raised an exception, this file was searched for a
    localized error message based on the exception's name.  The message was
    used as the "reason" associated with the exception.  Starting with 
    LJKit 0.9.6, this file is no longer used, and the Localizable.strings file
    of the application's main bundle is consulted instead.  This file is
    retained as a template for you to use when amending your application's
    Localizable.strings file.

    The numbers following LJStreamError refer to an error domain and error code, 
    respectively, as defined in the CFNetwork documentation.  (See "CFNetwork Constants")

    LJKit will first look for a key with the appropriate numbers.  For example, if the 
    error domain is 1 and the error code is 27, LJKit will attempt to load a string for
    the key "LJStreamError_1_27".  If no such key exists, it will load the string for
    the key "LJStreamError_%d_%d" and perform printf-style substitution on the string
    itself.
    
    The same goes for the LJHTTPStatus_%d error messages below.
